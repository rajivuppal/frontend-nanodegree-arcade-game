- The game board has three sections,

    - The _water section_ in the top
- The goal of the game is for the player to get to the _water section_, at the top, starting from the _grass section_, which is at the bottom and also the starting position for the player.
- There are a number of enemies that are constantly moving across the _blocks section_, from left to right at varying and unpredictable speeds.
- The player must try avoid a collision with the enemies, while trying to cross over from the _grass section_ to the _water section_.  If the player happens to collide with an enemy while trying to cross the _blocks section_, the player will be set back to the starting position.

    - the _Up_ arrow will move player up one step
    - the _Down_ arrow will move the player down one step
    - the _Left_ arrow will move the player left one step
    - the _Right_ arrow will move the player right one step
- If the player is able to get to the _water section_ that is considered a _**SUCCESS**_
